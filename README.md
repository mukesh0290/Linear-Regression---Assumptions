# Linear-Regression---Assumptions
Autocorrelation occurs when the residual errors are dependent on each other.The presence of correlation in error terms drastically reduces modelâ€™s accuracy.This usually occurs in time series models where the next instant is dependent on previous instant. Autocorrelation can be tested with the help of Durbin-Watson test.The null hypothesis of the test is that there is no serial correlation. The Durbin-Watson test statistics is defined as: Image for post The test statistic is approximately equal to 2*(1-r) where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals. Thus, for r == 0, indicating no serial correlation, the test statistic equals 2. This statistic will always be between 0 and 4. The closer to 0 the statistic, the more evidence for positive serial correlation. The closer to 4, the more evidence for negative serial correlation.
